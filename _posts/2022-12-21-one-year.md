What? One year... already?!

365 days ago was released the original work of Bob, enabling players to host their own Titanfall2 servers with custom
rules sets and gamemodes! We've come a long way since then:
* 235072 players;
* 45 game releases;
* 76368 Discord community members.

Even if players don't always see (or understand) what they're doing, our developers have also been hard at work during 
the past 12 months:
* new master server;
* new in-game interface components;
* Discord integration;
* websites;
* game launchers;
* a ton of bugfixes.

And there's more to come!

## Community corner

Northstar allows people to replace some of the in-game existing models (be it pilots, titans or weapons) with imported
models. Here's a selection of the most downloaded skins.

But our community also like to import elements of their beloved games into the Titanfall Universe; DubryZuber shows it well with this [V1 (Pathfinder?) skin](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/package/DobryZuber/ZuberV1/) from Ultrakill:
