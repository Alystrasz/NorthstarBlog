What? One year... already?!

365 days ago was released the original work of Bob, enabling players to host their own Titanfall2 servers with custom
rules sets and gamemodes! We've come a long way since then:
* 235072 players;
* 45 game releases;
* 76368 Discord community members.

Even if players don't always see (or understand) what they're doing, our developers have also been hard at work during 
the past 12 months:
* new master server;
* new in-game interface components;
* Discord integration;
* websites;
* game launchers;
* a ton of bugfixes.

And there's more to come!

## Community corner

Northstar allows people to replace some of the in-game existing models (be it pilots, titans or weapons) with imported
models. Here's a selection of the most downloaded skins.

Put some glow in your life with [morebagels's XenonWeaponSet](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/package/morebagels/XenonWeaponSet/).

Wanna celebrate each one of your kills? S2ymi has a [Mastiff skin](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/package/S2Mods/MastiffKillReactiveSkin/) for you:

But our community also like to import elements of their beloved games into the Titanfall Universe; DubryZuber shows it well with this [V1 (Pathfinder?) skin](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/package/DobryZuber/ZuberV1/) from Ultrakill:

Finally, I cannot wrap up this community section without mentioning [Smurfson](https://www.youtube.com/@Smurfson/videos), who created amazing trailer videos about Titanfall2 and Northstar:

## What's next

As you saw in the previous section, skin modding is possible since a few months, thanks to the hard work of our developers; we're now working on importing new maps in game, 

Titanfall2 game developers worked on some content that was scrapped in the final game release, but which some files still made it; these contents include the [already-released Archon titan](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/package/GalacticMoblin/MoblinArchon/), and the "Fort war" gamemode (not yet released):
